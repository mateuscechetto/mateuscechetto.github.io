## Features 

- The "programs" are presented in windows
- Those windows can be moved and resized
- Once a window is clicked it gets focused
- The user can change the focused window using the start bar
- The Start menu can be opened with the Windows (or Command) key
- The Start menu is closed when the user clicks at any other place on the screen
- It has 2 languages: English and Portuguese
- It recognizes user's browser language and set to one of the two, the default language is English (in case user's language isn't either of those)
- The language can be changed in real time, without reloading the page
- It is mobile friendly
- The clock updates in real time
- It has other programs such as Paint and Minesweeper
  - The Paint canvas resizes with the window
  - The user can change the brush size on Paint
  - The user can clear, download and open the Paint draw in a new tab
  - The Minesweeper has 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Normal and Hard
  - The window is resized if you change to a level with a bigger board than the current size of the window
  - Flags are added on right click
  - When the player hit a bomb, the board is revealed and the clicked cell becomes red
  - The timer starts on first click, stops when the game ends, and resets whenever a new game starts


### Upcoming Features

- Minesweeper: can't hit a bomb on first click
