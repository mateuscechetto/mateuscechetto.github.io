The bot allows viewers to share their personal ratings for the cards directly through Twitch chat. These ratings are then collected and stored in a Google Sheets document for reference.</p><p>For the technical implementation, I utilized <b>Node, Express, OAuth2, JWT, MongoDB (Mongoose), tmi.js, </b> and <b>Google Sheets API</b>.

If the provided short URL is valid, the user is redirected; otherwise, they are directed to the front-end error page.</p><p>To fulfill the requirements, the following strategies were adopted:</p><ul><li>Upon receiving a URL, a unique sequential ID is generated. This ID increments sequentially, ensuring uniqueness even in concurrent scenarios.</li><li>The unique ID is then encoded to base62, resulting in a short URL composed of numbers, lowercase, and uppercase letters.</li><li>For retrieving the original URL from the short URL, the encoded short URL is decoded to obtain the corresponding ID in the database.</li></ul><p>Despite making short URLs predictable (which could pose a security risk), sequential IDs were chosen (using JPA's GeneratedValue) to ensure uniqueness even in scenarios involving <b>concurrency</b>.</p><hr><p>The front-end application was developed using <b>Angular</b> and utilizes <b>Angular Material</b> components for its user interface.</p><p>The interface design is <b>clean</b> and <b>simple</b>, offering an intuitive user experience.</p><p>To maintain a <b>history</b> of shortened URLs, user data is stored in the browser's <b>local storage</b>.</p>"
