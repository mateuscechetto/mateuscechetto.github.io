It was used <b>JPA (Java Persistence API)</b> and <b>Postgres</b> to manage the database.</p><p>It's composed of a <b>POST</b> and a <b>GET</b> endpoint. The POST generates a short URL given an URL and the GET redirects the user to the original website given a shorted URL or, if the short URL is a valid one, redirects to the front end error page.</p><p>To match all the requirements, the following startegies were adopted: </p><ul><li>Once an URL is given, an unique ID is created for it. It is made sequentially, incrementing 1 from the last ID</li><li>The unique ID (a number) is encoded to base62, resulting in a value with numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters. That value is the short URL</li><li>To find the original URL from the short URL, the short is decoded, the result is the id in the database</li></ul><p>It was chosen to use sequential ID (using JPA GeneratedValue), to guarantee unique ID's even when there is <b>concurrency</b>, even tho it makes the short URL's predictable (which could be a security flaw).</p><hr><p>The front end aplication was made with <b>Angular</b>, using <b>Angular Material</b> components.</p><p>The interface is <b>clean</b> and <b>simple</b> to use.</p><p>In order to keep a <b>history</b> of which URLs the user had shorten, they are stored in browser's <b>local storage</b>.</p>"
